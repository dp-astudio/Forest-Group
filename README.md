Hi, 

This is my first public project, where I'm sharing what I've learned so far from front-end courses at MMC School (https://mmcschool.pl/). 
The design is not mine, it's part of the course. 

As this is my first project, I would love to get feedback on the code.

In the code, I also use some elements that are not originally mine: 
1. Hamburger menu by https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers
2. On scroll animation by https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/
3. Icon from www.freepik.com

This is not a commercial project, but a coding exercise.
